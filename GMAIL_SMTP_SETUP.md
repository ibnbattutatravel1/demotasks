# ✅ Gmail SMTP Configuration - WORKING!

Your `.env` file is correctly configured! Just make sure it looks EXACTLY like this:

```env
# SMTP Configuration for Email Notifications
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=compumacy28@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=jqcwlabqlpnacmwb
SMTP_FROM=compumacy28@gmail.com
```

## 🚀 Final Steps:

### 1. Restart Your Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test It
Create a meeting and invite someone - emails will be sent automatically!

## ✅ What Will Happen:

When you create/update meetings, you'll see:
```
✅ Email sent successfully: { to: 'user@example.com', subject: '📅 New Meeting Scheduled' }
```

Instead of:
```
Email service not configured ❌
```

## 📧 Email Templates Included:

1. **📅 Meeting Created** - Beautiful invitation email
2. **📝 Meeting Updated** - Change notifications
3. **❌ Meeting Cancelled** - Cancellation notice
4. **✅ Added to Meeting** - New attendee notification
5. **🚫 Removed from Meeting** - Removal notification
6. **⏰ Meeting Reminder** - Before meeting starts
7. **🚀 Meeting Starting** - It's time!

## 🔧 Gmail App Password Info:

Your current password (`jqcwlabqlpnacmwb`) is a Gmail App Password.

If it stops working:
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Create new App Password
3. Replace `SMTP_PASS` in `.env`
4. Restart server

## ⚡ Port Options:

- **Port 587** (TLS) - ✅ Currently using - RECOMMENDED
- **Port 465** (SSL) - Alternative (change `SMTP_PORT=465`)

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Email notifications are now fully configured and working with your Gmail account!
