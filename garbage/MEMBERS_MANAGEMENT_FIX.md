# Community Members Management - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Members List Not Showing Names and Emails ✅
**Problem**: Current members list showed no names and no emails

**Root Cause**: The component was expecting `user_name` and `user_email` fields, but the API returns `name` and `email`

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the `Member` interface to use `name` and `email` instead of `user_name` and `user_email`
- Added avatar display with initials
- Shows "Unknown User" / "No email" as fallback if data is missing

### Issue 2: Add Member Using Email Instead of User Selection ✅
**Problem**: Add member dialog asked for email input instead of selecting from existing users

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced email input with user selection from website users
- Added search functionality to filter users by name or email
- Shows user list with avatar, name, and email
- Click to select a user from the list
- Filters out users who are already members
- Filters out admin users (they have automatic access)

## API Compatibility

The API endpoint `/api/communities/[id]/members` already supports:
- ✅ `POST` with `user_id` and `role` (not email)
- ✅ `GET` returns `name` and `email` fields from joined users table

No API changes needed.

---

## Summary

Both issues are now **100% fixed**:

1. ✅ **Members list displays correctly** with names, emails, and avatars
2. ✅ **Add member now uses user selection** instead of email input

The component now:
- Fetches real website users from `/api/users`
- Filters out existing members and admins
- Provides searchable user selection
- Shows proper user information throughout
