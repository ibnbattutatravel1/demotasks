## How It Works

### Public Community Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - User creates account on your website
   - User is now authenticated

2. **Accessing Public Community**
   - User navigates to any public community
   - **No membership check** - immediate access
   - User sees all posts, files, and content

3. **Participating in Community**
   - **Create Post**: Click "New Post" → Write content → Publish ✅
   - **Comment**: Click "Comment" on any post → Write comment → Post ✅
   - **Upload File**: Click "Upload" → Select file → Upload ✅
   - **React**: Click reaction button (👍 ❤️ 🎉) → Reaction added ✅

4. **No Membership Required**
   - User does NOT appear in member list
   - User has full contributor-level access
   - No admin approval needed
   - Instant participation

---

### Private Community Flow (Comparison)

1. **User must be invited** by admin/owner
2. **Added to member list** with specific role
3. **Permissions based on role**:
   - Viewer: Read only
   - Contributor: Can post/comment/upload
   - Editor: Can edit others' posts
   - Moderator: Can moderate content
   - Admin: Can manage settings
   - Owner: Full control

---

---

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Check
```typescript
// Step 1: Verify user is authenticated
const token = req.cookies.get(AUTH_COOKIE)?.value
if (!token) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })

const payload = await verifyAuthToken(token)
const userId = payload.sub
```

### Community Visibility Check
```typescript
// Step 2: Check community type
const community = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT visibility FROM communities 
  WHERE id = ${communityId}
`)

if (community.visibility === 'private') {
  // Check membership
  const member = await db.execute(sql`
    SELECT role FROM community_members 
    WHERE community_id = ${communityId} AND user_id = ${userId}
  `)
  
  if (!member) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Not a member' }, { status: 403 })
  }
} else {
  // Public community - allow action
  // No membership check required
}
```

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Authentication Required
- Users MUST be logged in
- Anonymous access not allowed
- Valid session token required

### ✅ Community Must Exist
- Community ID validated
- Archived communities blocked
- Invalid IDs rejected

### ✅ Settings Respected
- If community disables comments → blocked
- If community disables reactions → blocked
- If community disables file uploads → blocked

### ✅ Rate Limiting (Recommended)
Consider adding rate limiting for:
- Post creation (e.g., 10 posts per hour)
- Comment creation (e.g., 30 comments per hour)
- File uploads (e.g., 5 files per hour)
- Reactions (e.g., 100 reactions per hour)
